Building Instructions: The program can be build at least with Android studio.
Just import the project and it can be run with the virtual machine and with a real
device. The program have a list view showing the containers, sensors
and actuators and a view showing the selected device and the related tools for adjusting
device status. It is also possible to change the URL for the central unit connections and
disable the sensors that are used. When the sensors are on it is possible to shutdown a
binary device by turning the phone up-side down. With decimal device it is possible
to increase or decrease the value by tilting the phone to the right or to the left, respectfully.
The system informs about the changes in the system and also make changes to the state of
the device in real-


Testing:

For testing I used a real device (Nexus 5) and an emulator at the same time to ensure that the
changes made would affect on both devices in real time.
